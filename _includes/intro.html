        I'm currently a compiler engineer in the language team at
        <a class="underline_link" href="https://relational.ai" target="_blank">RelationalAI</a>,
        where we build an awesome
        <span class="emph">relational knowledge graph management system</span>. On the
        language team, we design an easy-to-use yet expressive declarative query language.

        I graduated in 2022 from the
        <a class="underline_link" href="https://sydney.edu.au" target="_blank">University of Sydney</a>
        with a PhD in programming languages. My research work focused on the declarative
        logic programming language, Datalog, culminating in my thesis
        <emph>Provenance, Incremental Evaluation, and Debugging in Datalog</emph>.
        As part of my research, I was a major contributor to the
        <a class="underline_link", href="https://souffle-lang.org">Souffl√©</a> Datalog engine,
        adding important debugging and incremental evaluation features.

        <strong>Away from the computer</strong>, you can usually find me playing tennis, ultimate frisbee,
        doing (<span class="emph">attempting</span>) pottery, or behind a
        camera trying to find cool things to take pictures of.
